						.blog__column-title Benefits of Mass Texts

						.blog__column-text.text One of the most obvious benefits of sending out a mass group text to your customers is getting more customer feedback with this method. It is much easier to send a quick response through text to any polls that you may need to send out. Additionally, if you are texting from a local number, your customers will feel much more comfortable texting you back with any questions. Your customers can also text you back to confirm appointments, cancel, or even let you know if they will be late for an appointment. Only some people check their email, but it is hard to ignore a text message these days. Additionally, you will see an increase in the response rate from your customers. Using SlyText to communicate with your employees can be a great way to communicate anything they need to know. This could be reminders for tasks, events, or other important dates. These notifications help avoid confusion about the details and can lead to a smoother event for your company. These mass SMS messages can also inform your staff of upcoming deliveries or other important information they need.

						.blog__column-title What Kind of Mass Texts Can You Send?
						.blog__column_media
							img(src="../img/blog1.svg" alt="").blog__column_media_image
						.blog__column-text.text There are three mass business texts: short-code, long-code, and toll-free. Short code texting is the text you receive from companies about flight updates, reminders, or shipping notices. Though this is obviously a great option for sending SMS marketing messages, it can be a costly SMS service. The other mass text you can send out to your customers is long code text. These come with a 10-digit number, which will help your customers feel more comfortable responding to or opening any links you send them. One downside to this method is that many carriers restrict these numbers, meaning you may be limited to 100 people from your contact list in a group. Toll-free texting is an excellent option for sending a mass text from a toll-free number. This method's benefits are two-way conversations, high delivery rates, and no opt-in requirements.
