                            a mass text message to showcase a sale for your customers
                            or you want to broadcast a closing, SlyText can help you
                            with this process and make it much more manageable. Sure,
                            you can get on the computer and send a mass email, but
                            there are many benefits to bulk text messages you will not
                            receive through email. No matter why you need to send a bulk
                            sms message, SlyText is the messaging app for you.

                        <div class="blog__column-text text">One of the most obvious benefits
                            of sending out a mass group text to your customers is getting
                            more customer feedback with this method. It is much easier to
                            send a quick response through text to any polls that you may
                            need to send out. Additionally, if you are texting from a
                            local number, your customers will feel much more comfortable
                            texting you back with any questions.
                            Your customers can also text you back to confirm appointments,
                            cancel, or even let you know if they will be late for an
                            appointment. Only some people check their email, but it is hard
                            to ignore a text message these days. Additionally, you will see
                            an increase in the response rate from your customers.
                            Using SlyText to communicate with your employees can be a
                            great way to communicate anything they need to know. This could
                            be reminders for tasks, events, or other important dates. These
                            notifications help avoid confusion about the details and can
                            lead to a smoother event for your company. These mass SMS
                            messages can also inform your staff of upcoming deliveries or
                            other important information they need.

                        <div class="blog__column-text text">There are three mass business
                            texts: short-code, long-code, and toll-free. Short code texting
                            is the text you receive from companies about flight updates,
                            reminders, or shipping notices. Though this is obviously a
                            great option for sending SMS marketing messages, it can be
                            a costly SMS service.
                            The other mass text you can send out to your customers is
                            long code text. These come with a 10-digit number, which
                            will help your customers feel more comfortable responding
                            to or opening any links you send them. One downside to this
                            method is that many carriers restrict these numbers,
                            meaning you may be limited to 100 people from your contact
                            list in a group.
                            Toll-free texting is an excellent option for sending
                            a mass text from a toll-free number. This method's benefits
                            are two-way conversations, high delivery rates, and no opt-in
                            requirements.

                            messaging services because SlyText is a web-based texting service.
                            This means you can send SMS text messages to any mobile device you want,
                            whether your customers have an iPhone or an Android. From the SlyText web
                            browser, you can send messages to any phone number you want. You will be
                            able to choose a day and time for delivery, and you will also be able to
                            see your messaging history on the browser.

                                2. Log in to your new SlyText account and choose which phone number you will be using.
                                This will be the number that your customers will receive all mass communications.
                                <br>
                                3. Enter the mobile numbers of everyone you want to receive your group text messages.
                                SlyText limits how many messages can be sent out at one time. The daily limit is 1,000
                                texts a day, and they can only be sent out at a rate of 14 messages per minute.

                                4. Next, you will see a scheduling option for your texting campaign. You will either
                                be able to send your message immediately, or you can schedule to have it sent later.

                                5. Click send! You will then be able to check the interface to ensure that your messages
                                have been sent. You will also see scheduled texts in the "Scheduled Messages" tab.

                            that you put on file. Remember that, though low-cost, SMS forwarding will
                            incur an extra charge on your account.
                            Additionally, on your account, you can check the success of any current
